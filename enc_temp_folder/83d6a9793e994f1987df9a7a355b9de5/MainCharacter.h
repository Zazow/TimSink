//It's very important that this enum is UENUM, because the code will look for UENUM by the given name and crash if the UENUM can't be found. BlueprintType is there so we can use these in blueprints, too. Just in case. Can be neat to define ability packages.

	//You may also do something like define an enum element name that is not actually mapped to an input, for example if you have a passive ability that isn't supposed to have an input. This isn't usually necessary though as you usually grant abilities via input ID,
	//which can be negative while enums cannot. In fact, a constant called "INDEX_NONE" exists for the exact purpose of rendering an input as unavailable, and it's simply defined as -1.
	//Because abilities are granted by input ID, which is an int, you may use enum elements to describe the ID anyway however, because enums are fancily dressed up ints.
